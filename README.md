TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew.

DATASET
The dataset used for this project is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not. The dataset has been pre-processed to handle missing values and categorical variables.

METHODOLOGIES USED:
   1) Data preprocessing :data cleaning, removing duplicates, filling the null values in data, checking for skewness
   2) Exploratory data analysis + Feature engineering : data visulization between different features and survival rate
   3) Model training : The model has been trained with Logistic Regression  for validation and training purposes only.
   4) Model evaluation : used confusion matrix,accuracy_score

RESULT
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 95.7% on the test set, outperforming other models considered.
